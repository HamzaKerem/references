Images are layer based... and is read-only
every instruction in the dockerfile represents a layer.

When building an image, the changing layer and all layers after are processed..
existing, unchanged, previous layers remain untouched.

The container layer (containing the image layer) is r-w

docker images # list images
docker rmi IMG_ID.. # remove img
Container needs to be removed before removing img
docker image prune # remove all unused imgs
docker image inspect IMG_ID # inspect img
docker image prune -a # remove all images including tagged imgs

Sharing via DockerHub:
docker push IMG
docker pull IMG
docker login|logout

docker search IMG # search for IMG
