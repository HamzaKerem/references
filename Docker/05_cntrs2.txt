docker exec -it my_cntr CMD # Execute a command (i.e. bash) in a running container
docker run -it node-util npm init # no need to use 'CMD ["...	' since command is specificed
# if CMD statement is added in dockerfile, it's overwritten..

in dockerfile:
...
ENTRYPOINT [ "npm" ]
...
docker run -it -v "$(pwd):/app" mynpm install # continues from ENTRYPOINT statement

======================================
DEPLOYMENT aka running cntrs on remote machines
=====================================

Bind mounts shouldn't be used in production.. It's best to build imgs on local devices,
push to docker hub.. pull on remote machine and run

Push a new image to a registry exmample:
docker image tag rhel-httpd:latest registry-host:5000/myadmin/rhel-httpd:latest
docker image push registry-host:5000/myadmin/rhel-httpd:latest

A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a
secure, isolated private cloud hosted within a public cloud. AWS ECS is just a
logical grouping (cluster) of EC2 instances, and all the EC2 instances part of
an ECS act as Docker host i.e. ECS can send command to launch a container on
them (EC2). EC2 - is simply a remote (virtual) machine. ECS stands for Elastic
Container Service. In AWS fully managed services, AWS manages the servers,
storage, OS, databases, and other critical resources fundamental to service
infrastructure ... no sys admin experience is required..the configuration is done through
a massively simple web interface.

A load balancer is a device or service that distributes network or application
traffic across resources to support an application. A security group controls
the traffic that is allowed to reach and leave the resources that it is
associated with. For example, after you associate a security group with an EC2
instance, it controls the inbound and outbound traffic for the instance.
When you create a VPC, it comes with a default security group. You can create
additional security groups for a VPC, each with their own inbound and outbound
rules. You can specify the source, port range, and protocol for each inbound
rule. You can specify the destination, port range, and protocol for each
outbound rule. Note: EFS refers to elastic file system.

multi cntr projects might need to be split across multiple host machines.
containerized apps *might* need a build step.
