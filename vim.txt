Searching:
/<search word>: search forwards

CTRL-v: enter block mode
:help v_b_<command>: get help on a specific Visual Block command (i.e. v_b_c)

typed character deletes an existing character)

Copy and Paste:
y: yank (use Visual Mode to utilize yanking)
p: put / paste after cursor

Programming Related:
:syntax on: turn on syntax highlighting
:set background?: show background value ('bg' is the short option for background)
:set background=light/dark: set background value
:set filetype=c: set filetype for current file
:set shiftwidth=4: set shiftwidth 
:set cindent: set C style indentation
:set smartindent: set indentation to be same as the preceding line 
:set autoindent: set indentation to be same as the preceding line 
Insert Mode + CTRL-d: reverse indent
>: indent by 1 shiftwidth (See: shiftwidth)
<: unindent by 1 shiftwidth
('[num]>>' to indent num lines. Utilize '>' with Visual Block mode or '%') 
=: indent text (position cursor on first '{', then execute '=%')
%: find matching parenthesis, bracket, comments, preprocessor directives, etc. 
(cursor must be on one of those) 
[num]K: open up man page of the selected word sectioned under section 'num' (cursor must be under the selected word)

Abbreviation:
:abbreviate ad advertisement: abbreviate 'advertisement' as 'ad'.
<insert abbreviation> + space: type out whole string
(Note: '<space>' tells vim to use the space character. i.e. :abbreviate space <space>)
:abbreviate: list all abbreviations

Mapping:
:map <key> <commands>: map <commands> to <key> (i.e. :map <F5> i{<ESC>ea}<ESC>)
(Note: <key> can be multiple keys or any string. A mapping will supersede a default vim command.)
:map: list all mappings

Controlling what backspace does:
:set backspace=indent/eol/start: select a single backspace value or combine them all instead by using commas inbetween values

Saving settings:
:mkvimrc <file>: writes all settings of the current session to <file>
:source <file>: read and set settings of the current session from <file>
(Note: the following initialization files are searched for when vim is launched, once the first one is found, settings
are loaded and none of the rest are read: ~/.vimrc, ~/_vimrc, ~/.exrc ~/_exrc. In fact, ~/.exrc was used by Vi.) 
:version: shows version and initialization file information

Command-Mode:
(Note: vi is based off another text editor called "ex")
Q: enter command-line mode
:visual: command-line mode
:n1,n2 print: print the lines between n1 and n2
:% print: print the entire file 
:shell: enter shell ('exit' to go back to vim)

Dealing with text files:
:set textwidth=30: line breaks are automatically inserted after 30 characters
:set wrapmargin=10: line breaks are automatically inserted 10 characters before the maximum screen width is reached 
Visual Mode + gq: format the selected paragraph to be `textwidth` characters each line 
gq4j: format the following 5 lines to be `textwidth` characters each line 
gqgq: format current line
gqip: format the current paragraph
:1,5 left/center/right <width>: center a range of lines 
:left/center/right: align the current line according to textwidth
:set formatoptions=<characters>: control how Vim performs automatic wrapping (characters 'cq' is good for programming)
:set formatprg=fmt: set the formating program to be UNIX fmt instead of Vim's internal module
:!}fmt: filter the paragraph and use fmt for formatting
:set fileformats=unix,dos: tells Vim to first check if the file is in Unix format, then in the MS-DOS format
(: move back one sentence
): move forward one sentence 
{: move back one paragraph 
}: move forward one paragraph 
g?<motion>: encrypt a block of text with the rot13 algorithm

Automatic Completion:
CTRL-p (in Insert Mode): implement completion suggestions after searching for previous matches (Note: repeating CTRL-p will undo 
implementation)
CTRL-n (in Insert Mode): implement completion suggestions after searching for upcoming matches
:set ignorecase: tells Vim to ignore case for completion suggestions

Commands to utilize more:
C: delete line and enter insert mode
I: move cursor to the beginning of line and append 
J: join lines
Ctrl-U (in insert mode): kill line up to cursor (equivilant to d0)
P: put / paste before cursor
:autowrite: auto-write before editing next or previous buffer
z: center current line to be in the middle of the screen
:set <option>?: display the value of <option>

Notes:            
Look into Visual block + c & Visual block + A. Supposed to edit multiple lines but doesn't work.
