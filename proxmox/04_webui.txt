The structure goes as:
Datacenter = Contains all Proxmox VE servers (nodes)
  ├── Node = A separate physical machine running a hypervisor
      ├── LocalNetwork = Network interfaces and bridges configured on the node
      ├── Local = Local directory-based storage (e.g., `/var/lib/lxc` or `/var/lib/vz`)
      ├── Local-LVM = LVM-thin storage pool for VM disks and container volumes
      ├── Shared Storage (Optional) = External storage like NFS, iSCSI, or Ceph, shared across nodes

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Note: A single bare-metal server cannot have multiple non-virtual nodes in the traditional sense of bare-metal hypervisor architecture. Each node is typically a separate physical machine running a hypervisor. However, there are some advanced cases where multiple node-like environments can exist on one physical machine.

LVM (Logical Volume Manager) and LVM-Thin (Thin Provisioning for LVM) are both storage management techniques used in Proxmox VE to manage disk space efficiently. They help allocate storage dynamically to virtual machines (VMs) and containers.
