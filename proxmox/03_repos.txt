Ceph is an open-source, distributed storage system that integrates with Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE) to provide scalable, fault-tolerant, and high-performance storage. In Proxmox, Ceph is used primarily as a hyper-converged storage system where multiple Proxmox nodes contribute to a shared storage pool.
