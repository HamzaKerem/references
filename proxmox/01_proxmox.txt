Proxmox is an open-source virtualization platform (bare-metal hypervisor) based
on Debian Linux. It allows users to deploy and manage virtual machines (VMs) and
containers with ease. Proxmox is widely used in server environments for its
powerful features, intuitive web interface, and ability to consolidate multiple
workloads on a single physical host.

Proxmox Virtual Environment (aka VE) can just be flashed to a USB and then
inserted into server.

Note: you can set hostname to pve.local initially
