lemonbar is lightweight status bar.
Configuration is done through `screen-rc`-like format strings/commands.

Configuration (in script my_script.sh):
while true; do
	sleep 1

	echo "%{l} $(acpi)"
	echo "%{c} $(date)"
	echo "%{r} $(whoami)"
done

Apply configuration:
./my_script.sh | lemonbar # Preferably placed in the last line of WM startup/config script
