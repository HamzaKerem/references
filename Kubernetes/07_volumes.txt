K8s can mount volumes into cntrs. Volumes are attached to pods
and are pod specific. All cntrs in that one pod which the vol.
is attached to will be able to used that vol.

K8s supports many drivers and types regarding volumes but volumes are
not always persistent, unlike named vols in Docker.

Volume types:
emptyDir: creates new empty dir whenever pod starts and fills w/
data as long as pod is alive. Cntr starts/restarts etc. volume is unaffected
yet if the pod is killed, volume is emptied. Survives cntr restart but not 
pod restart.
hostPath: is similiar to bind mount in which the path to be mounted on to
the pod is a path defined on the host machine. Has multiple type options
such as Directory and DirectoryOrCreate
csi (Cntr Storage Interface): is very flexible..it defines an interface which
any built driver solutions that can utilize the interface can be used

Persistent Volumes are entities inside the cluster that are independent of 
pods and nodes. Persistent Volume Claims are entities inside of pods that 
point to Persistent Volumes. PV's don't store data on the nodes!

"Normal" volumes:
- Attached to pod & pod lifecycle
- Defined & created with pod
- repetetive and hard to administer on global level

Persistent volumes:
- is a standalone cluster resource
- created standalone, claimed via PVC
- can be defined once and used multiple times
