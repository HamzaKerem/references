Simply rerun `kubectl apply -f=FILE` for changes to be made to object
once the config (yaml) file has been modified.

Delete obj:
kubectl delete OBJ_TYPE OBJ # kubectl delete my-first-kub-app deployment
# or
kubectl delete -f=FILE.. # deletes resources created based on file
# or
kubectl delete OBJ_TYPE -l KEY=VALUE # delete obj w/ the corresponding labels

Can have multiple service definitions in a config file, meaning
master-deployment.yaml can contain contents of deployment.yaml and
service.yaml. Best practice to put service first. Must use `---` syntax.
