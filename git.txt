Quick Notes:
Remote repository: Most up to date and trusted repo.
Commit: Create a checkpoint in the local repository. 
Push: Send commit to remote repo. as neccessary.
Branch: Copy of a repo. at a certain point.
Master Branch: Main commit (checkpoint) history.
HEAD: Pointer to the current branch.

Basics:
initialize git: git init
show status: git status
show log: git log

Adding files and Commits:
add file: git add <file> 
create commit: git commit -m "made ... changes"
Note: Files need to be added before being commited in 
order for git to be able to track them. The '-a' flag in 
git commit -am "..." allows for automatically adding modified files.

Branching:
show branches: git branch
(Note: Header is marked with a '*')
delete branch: git branch -D <branch>
switch to branch: git checkout <branch>
create new branch and switch: git checkout -b <branch>

Merging:
merge <branch> with current branch: git merge <branch>

Merge Conflicts:

a = 1 # Non conflicting
<<<< HEAD
b = 2 # Conflicting changes #1
=====
b = 3 # Conflicting changes #2 
>>>> 57123c...... (commit hash)
c = 4 # Non conflicting
d = 5 # Non conflicting
....

Pushing to a remote repo:
1) Create a new repo on github
2) git remote add origin https://github.com/<USER>/<REPO>
# A 'remote' called "origin" is a URL to another repository
3) git push -u origin master

Pulling:
Get the most recent commits from a remote repo: git pull

Configuration:
Edit ~/.gitconfig: git config --global --edit

Workflow Example:
git init # initialize
git add readme.md # add file
git commit -m "Added readme" # commit changes
git checkout -b safe_branch # create new branch and switch to it
git add file.txt # add new file
git commit -m "Added file.txt" # commit changes
git checkout master # switch back to master branch
git merge safe_branch # merge safe_branch with master branch
