OpenVPN is a robust and highly flexible VPN daemon. 
It supports SSL/TLS security, Ethernet bridging, TCP or UDP tunnel 
transport through proxies or NAT.Additionally it has support for dynamic IP 
addresses and DHCP, scalability to hundreds or thousands of users, and 
portability to most major OS platforms. OpenVPN is tightly bound to the 
OpenSSL library, and derives much of its crypto capabilities from it. 
It supports conventional encryption using a pre-shared secret key 
(Static Key mode) or public key security (SSL/TLS mode) using client & 
server certificates. Additionally it supports unencrypted TCP/UDP tunnels. 

OpenVPN requires TUN/TAP support, which is already configured in the 
default kernel. Users of custom kernel should make sure to enable the 'tun'
module.
