Quick Notes:
Use sh, which is usually linked to dash,
for speed and minimalism.
Use printf instead of echo.
Redirect error messages to stderr.
sh forces you to use UNIX utilities such as
cut, paste, etc. unlike bash, which offers bloated built-in
solutions.

Test command exit status:
if ! cmd > /dev/null; then
	....
fi
